## data clean

I try to use the quarto to record my learn progress of R.

```{r}
#| label: hist-x
#| fig-cap: "正态分布直方图"
x <- rnorm(200)
hist(x)
```
I am amazing about the quarto to write R scripts.Because I find it can run the code and it give me the plot. Maybe one day, it will become my often using tool.
